## Background of the problem

Many older adults struggle with modern smartphones because interfaces are small, cluttered, and require multiple steps to perform basic tasks. This leads to **frustration, missed medication and missed appointments.** In Malaysia and many other places, caregivers often need to remind seniors about medication and appointments, or to check activity  a manual process that wastes time and can fail when the senior is alone. There’s a need for an app that **reduces load, supports memory and routine, and helps family members stay informed** without constant calls.

## Objective

1.	To create a simple, reliable companion app that makes essential phone functions and health reminders immediately accessible to elderly users. 
2.	To improve medication and appointment adherence with clear reminders.
3. To provide step tracking to support daily activity monitoring and encourage healthier routines.
4.	To keep family members informed through automated weekly summaries.

## Target users

- **Primary**: Older adults (50+) who are not tech-savvy and prefer simplified interfaces 
- **Secondary**: Family (children, relatives) who want lightweight remote monitoring and an easy way to set reminders.
